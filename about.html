                    <p>Kimberly Nao is an educator, student advocate, and kundalini yoga instructor. For the past 20 years she has worked with adolescents in various capacities. At the college level, Kimberly is currently an assistant professor in Mt. St. Mary&rsquo;s University&rsquo;s Education Department where she directs the Clear Credential and Instructional Leadership Programs. She has taught classes at UCLA&rsquo;s Teacher Education Program and has also provided professional development for teachers related to gender, sexuality, and race in secondary schooling. At the secondary level, she has worked as an English teacher, a support for struggling students, and a facilitator of various diversity and social justice workshops at Santa Monica High School. Kimberly has a passion for challenging educational structures that limit student engagement in schooling while also guiding students to negotiate school both academically and&nbsp;socially.</p>

<p>As&nbsp;a certified Kundalini Yoga Instructor, Kimberly incorporates elements of the yoga practice into her research agenda and in her work with youth. She has taught meditation and breathing techniques in Santa Monica High School&rsquo;s yoga program and English classrooms to help students learn to manage stress and academics. She has also taught meditation to school faculty and staff. She continues to build the bridge between yoga and schooling by incorporating yoga and meditation into her workshops for youth. Kimberly believes that kundalini yoga, a practice which has helped her overcome her own life challenges, is a new frontier in helping youth negotiate the educational system which can sometimes feel alienating. She also explores yoga as a new frontier in approaches to teaching in schools. More importantly, kundalini yoga can help youth and adults alike become aware of their own possibilities as fully actualized human&nbsp;beings.</p>
